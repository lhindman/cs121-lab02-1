## Lab Warmup - AverageOfThree (Required)
[Walkthough Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbxWwkW_BhyBdcCTsjuSvw9JgUc7RXre2)  

### Problem Description
Write an application that reads three integers values from the user with a Scanner and prints their average. Pay special attention to floating point vs integer divsion. The average value should not be truncated or rounded. Your program should match the expected output below. 

#### Expected Program Output (with sample user input)
```
Enter the first number: 15 
Enter the second number: 16
Enter the third number: 13
The average is: 14.666666666666666
```

### Implementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named AverageOfThree and create a new file named AverageOfThree.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in AverageOfThree.java
3. Test the program using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that the Lab Warmup is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.


## Lab Activity 1 - FractionConverter (Required)
### Problem Description
Write an application that prompts the user for the numerator and denominator of a fraction as integer values using a Scanner and prints the decimal equivalent of the fraction. Pay special attention to floating point vs integer division. The result should not be truncated or rounded.  Your program should match the expected output below.

#### Expected Program Output (with sample user input)
```
Enter the numerator: 2
Enter the denominator: 3
Floating point equivalent: 0.6666666666666666
```

### Impementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named FractionConverter and create a new file named FractionConverter.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in FractionConverter.java
3. Test the program with the sample user input using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Lab Activity 1 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Coding Journal (Optional)
Keep a journal of your activities as you work on this lab. Many of the best engineers that I have worked with professionally have kept some sort of engineering journal. I personally packed notebooks around with me for nearly 8 years before I began keeping my notes electronically.   

Your journal can track ideas, bugs, cool links, code snippets, shell commands, rants, or simply a reflection on what worked well or not-so-well with this lab activity. I will not be grading the content of your journal, but I will expect at least two timestamped journal entries of at least a 75 to 150 words each added to the provided Journal.md file.  The purpose of this component is to help develop the habit of taking notes and creating documentation while you code. The more detail you provide the better as that will help you if you ever need to refer back to this project in the future.

## Markdown Resources
Markdown is a notation that is used to format text documents.  It is widely used in Software Development shops around the world, which is why we're asking you to use it in your lab documentation.  

Github provides a guide for getting started:  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
