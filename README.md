## Lab Warmup - AverageOfThree
[Walkthough Video](https://boisestate.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0b5db284-756a-4f39-815d-ae24018a8721)  

### Problem Description
Write an application that reads three integers values from the user with a Scanner and prints their average. Pay special attention to floating point vs integer divsion. The average value should not be truncated or rounded. Your program should match the expected output below. 

#### Expected Program Output (with sample user input)
```
Enter the first number: 15 
Enter the second number: 16
Enter the third number: 13
The average is: 14.666666666666666
```

### Implementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named AverageOfThree and create a new file named AverageOfThree.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in AverageOfThree.java
3. Test the program using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that the Lab Warmup is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.


## Lab Activity 1 - FractionConverter
### Problem Description
Write an application that prompts the user for the numerator and denominator of a fraction as integer values using a Scanner and prints the decimal equivalent of the fraction. Pay special attention to floating point vs integer division. The result should not be truncated or rounded.  Your program should match the expected output below.

#### Expected Program Output (with sample user input)
```
Enter the numerator: 2
Enter the denominator: 3
Floating point equivalent: 0.6666666666666666
```

### Impementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named FractionConverter and create a new file named FractionConverter.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in FractionConverter.java
3. Test the program with the sample user input using the run link above the main method
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Lab Activity 1 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.
